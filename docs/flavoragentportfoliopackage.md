### Flavor Agent — governance layer for AI-mediated WordPress changes

**Role:** Builder / AI systems engineer / WordPress product engineer
**Status:** `0.1.0` release candidate / pre-tag
**Core stack:** WordPress plugin, PHP 8.2, Gutenberg, Site Editor, WordPress Abilities API, MCP, WordPress REST for activity/decisions/sync/attestation, Ed25519 site-key attestations, `@wordpress/*` packages (React), DataViews, PHPUnit, Jest, Playwright
**Retrieval & grounding (optional infrastructure):** WordPress AI Client / Connectors for text generation; optional Cloudflare AI Search for private pattern retrieval and WordPress developer-doc grounding; optional Cloudflare Workers AI embeddings plus Qdrant for vector-backed pattern retrieval
**License:** GPL-2.0-or-later

Flavor Agent is a WordPress plugin that lets AI work on a live site without unchecked control. It routes AI-mediated work through a governed loop: generate, validate, review, apply, record and optionally attest, then reverse safely when the live document still matches the recorded post-apply state.

The user experience stays inside WordPress instead of becoming a separate chatbot. Flavor Agent appears in native Gutenberg and wp-admin surfaces: Block Inspector recommendations, pattern inserter ranking, content recommendations, navigation guidance, template and template-part recommendations, Global Styles, Style Book, and `Settings > AI Activity`.

The programmatic layer exposes the same governance model through the WordPress Abilities API and MCP. The registry defines **30 ability contracts**: seven recommendation abilities, five signature-only preview/preflight abilities, fourteen helper/search/infra abilities, and four governed external-apply abilities.

**Proof points**

- **8 first-party recommendation surfaces** plus one admin approval/audit surface.
- **30 defined Ability contracts**, reconciled by category:

| Category                                   |  Count |
| ------------------------------------------ | -----: |
| Recommendation abilities                   |      7 |
| Preview / preflight abilities              |      5 |
| Public read / helper abilities             |     10 |
| Abilities-API-only helper / read abilities |      3 |
| Docs-search ability                        |      1 |
| Governed external-apply abilities          |      4 |
| **Total**                                  | **30** |

Of the fourteen helper/search/infra contracts, ten are public read helpers exposed through the universal MCP discovery path; three (`list-synced-patterns`, `get-synced-pattern`, `check-status`) stay Abilities-API-only; and `search-wordpress-docs` is a separate `manage_options` docs-search tool.

- **Governed external style applies:** agents can request Global Styles / Style Book changes, but only admins approve or reject them.
- **Server-backed audit and undo:** activity rows store provenance, request metadata, before/after state, undo state, and admin projection fields.
- **Self-signed attestation layer:** approved external style applies can emit tamper-evident site-key statements, public key material, live subject-state checks, and chained revert attestations when a signing key is configured.
- **Verification evidence:** latest recorded successful non-browser run with Plugin Check green is 2026-06-21 (`node scripts/verify.js --skip-e2e`, build, JS lint, Plugin Check, JS unit, PHP lint, and 1,567 PHP tests green); current local fast-loop artifact in this checkout, generated 2026-06-23, is `pass` for a non-browser run with Plugin Check and E2E intentionally skipped (`--skip=lint-plugin --skip-e2e`) and records 1,570 JS unit tests plus 1,628 PHP tests passing.

**Ethics / governance note**

The main risk is overconfident AI mutating a publishing system. Flavor Agent mitigates that by bounding operations, review-gating structural/theme changes, attributing every request/apply, enforcing freshness checks, optionally emitting signed site-key attestations for governed external style applies, and blocking undo when the site has drifted.

> Agent governance isn't a WordPress-shaped problem — any system that lets AI act on live state needs the same guarantees: bounded operations, gated review, attribution, provable rollback. I built the layer on WordPress because that's where my depth is; the pattern is portable.

## 2) Annotated case study

### Context

AI tools for WordPress often start as chat interfaces: ask for help, get generic advice, then manually copy changes back into the editor. Flavor Agent explores a more product-native path. It treats WordPress itself as the workflow surface and asks: **How can AI help edit a live site without becoming an unchecked autonomous actor?**

The repo's answer is a governance layer. Recommendations are the visible demo, but the deeper product is a contract for safe AI-mediated change: bounded schemas, review gates, activity attribution, freshness signatures, site-key attestation, and drift-safe undo.

### Objective

Build a WordPress-native AI system that can:

1. Use live editor, theme, block, pattern, and site context.
2. Suggest useful changes across real Gutenberg and Site Editor surfaces.
3. Keep structural and theme-level changes reviewable.
4. Record AI actions server-side with provenance.
5. Reverse changes only when the live state still matches the recorded post-apply state.
6. Expose safe programmatic contracts to external agents through Abilities API and MCP.
7. Emit self-signed public attestations for approved external style applies when a site signing key is configured.

### Approach

Flavor Agent uses one governed loop for executable recommendations.

**Generate.** Recommendation abilities run through a shared executor that normalizes input, attaches guidelines, routes provider metadata, and writes request diagnostics for non-signature-only requests.

**Validate.** Model output is constrained by strict JSON schemas and operation catalogs. The response schema uses strict objects with `additionalProperties: false`, and executable operations are limited to known vocabularies such as block `insert_pattern` / `replace_block_with_pattern`, style `set_styles` / `set_block_styles` / `set_theme_variation`, and bounded template operations.

**Review.** Structural and theme-level changes are review-gated. Inline-safe changes are separated from review-safe and advisory suggestions so the UI can avoid pretending every recommendation is executable.

**Apply and record.** Applies owned by Flavor Agent write server-backed activity rows with request metadata, before/after state, undo state, document scope, and admin projection fields for filtering.

**Attest.** Approved external Global Styles / Style Book applies can produce an in-toto-style statement over the applied operations, before/after digests, actor role, decision timing, and related activity id. The statement is signed with the site's configured Ed25519 key, stored in a retention-independent attestation table, and exposed with public verification routes. No key means no attestation, never a fake placeholder.

**Reverse.** Undo checks whether the live document still matches the recorded post-apply state. If the site changed after Flavor Agent acted, undo fails closed instead of clobbering human edits.

### Product surfaces

Flavor Agent currently demonstrates this governance layer across:

- Block Inspector recommendations.
- Pattern inserter ranking shelf.
- Content recommendation panel.
- Navigation advisory guidance.
- Site Editor template recommendations.
- Template-part recommendations.
- Global Styles recommendations.
- Style Book recommendations.
- `Settings > AI Activity` approval/audit page.

The boundaries are explicit. Content is editorial-only, pattern recommendations are browse/rank-first, navigation is advisory-only, and external-agent applies are limited to Global Styles / Style Book in this release.

### Programmatic surface

The registry defines 30 Abilities API contracts. The first-party UI executes recommendation abilities through the WordPress Abilities API, while REST remains for activity creation, admin decisions, undo transitions, and manual pattern sync.

The dedicated MCP server exposes the seven recommendation abilities and four external-apply abilities as direct tools. Ten read helpers are public through the universal MCP discovery path; three helper/read contracts stay Abilities-API-only because they expose synced-pattern or backend inventory details. The default MCP/Abilities path keeps preview and helper abilities available for safer preflight and discovery.

### External-agent governance

External agents can request a governed style apply, read status/attribution, list scoped activity, and undo executed style rows. Approval is deliberately **not** exposed as an ability. The admin decision stays in `Settings > AI Activity`, guarded by `manage_options` and the row's contextual mutation capability.

The decision service performs a second freshness check at approval time. If the Global Styles entity changed after the request was created, approval fails closed rather than applying stale operations.

When `FLAVOR_AGENT_ATTEST_PRIVATE_KEY` or the `flavor_agent_attest_private_key` filter provides an Ed25519 secret key, approved external style applies create a companion attestation row. Public routes expose `/attestations/{id}`, `/attestations/keys`, and `/attestations/{id}/subject-state`; the verifier checks signature integrity and whether the live subject still matches the attested digest. The admin detail view can run a site-served verification summary for convenience, while independent verification is performed with `php tools/attestation-verify.php <baseUrl> <attestationId>` against the public envelope, key, and subject-state endpoints. If an attested style row is undone, Flavor Agent can record a chained revert attestation that points back to the prior attestation id.

### Ranking and feedback loop

Flavor Agent includes contextual ranking infrastructure rather than relying only on model confidence. `RecommendationContextScorer` uses evidence such as prompt match, operation fit, support fit, docs freshness, pattern readiness, accessibility fit, design semantics, contrast preservation, preset adherence, responsive sanity, and complexity fit.

The blend contract combines model, deterministic, and contextual scores with default weights of `0.30`, `0.45`, and `0.25`.

Outcome diagnostics track recommendation events such as `shown`, `selected_for_review`, `stale_blocked`, `validation_blocked`, `insert_failed`, and `pattern_inserted_from_shelf`.

### Evaluation

The repo records meaningful engineering evidence rather than adoption metrics.

Latest recorded successful non-browser evidence: `node scripts/verify.js --skip-e2e` passed on **2026-06-21**, with build, JS lint, Plugin Check, JS unit, PHP lint, and PHPUnit green. That run recorded **1,567 PHP tests** passing.

Current local non-browser artifact: `output/verify/summary.json` generated on **2026-06-23** is `pass` for a fast non-browser loop with Plugin Check and both E2E suites intentionally skipped (`--skip=lint-plugin --skip-e2e`). In that artifact, build, JS lint, JS unit, PHP lint, and PHPUnit passed; the recorded test counts are **1,570 JS unit tests** and **1,628 PHP tests** passing.

Latest targeted attestation evidence: `vendor/bin/phpunit --filter Attestation` passed on **2026-06-22**. The exact test/assertion totals are intentionally omitted here because the targeted suite changes as attestation coverage grows.

Latest targeted browser governance evidence: the WP70 approvals spec passed on **2026-06-10** with `3` tests.

Latest full recorded browser-suite evidence is historical: Playground passed across two isolated full-suite runs on **2026-06-11**, and the Docker-backed WordPress 7.0 Site Editor suite passed on **2026-05-02** with `20 passed / 0 failed`. Full browser gates are re-run on the exact release commit before tagging.

Browser evidence is split intentionally: Playground covers fast post-editor smoke tests, while a Docker-backed WordPress 7.0 Site Editor harness covers refresh/drift-sensitive flows.

### Known limits

Flavor Agent is a release-candidate project, not a production-scale observability product. The admin activity page is a first governance-console slice with external style-apply decisions, structured diff/before-after summaries, and diagnostics, but not yet a rich visual diff viewer or cross-operator workflow system.

Attestation v1 is self-signed site-key attestation scoped to governed external Global Styles / Style Book applies and their attested reverts. It is not C2PA, not third-party identity, and not a transparency log. No attestation is emitted unless the site has a valid signing key configured.

The roadmap still includes richer audit/discovery, visual diffing, learning attribution, learning reports, fixture harvest, bounded local ranking feedback, and editable site preference summaries.

## 3) Three-slide explainer

### Slide 1 — Problem → product thesis

**Title:** AI proposes. WordPress approves.

**Main visual:**
Unchecked agent path vs governed WordPress path.

Unchecked path:
Prompt → model output → direct mutation → unclear provenance → risky undo

Flavor Agent path:
WordPress context → recommendation ability → schema validation → review gate → server-backed activity → optional site-key attestation → drift-safe undo

**Callouts**

- Native Gutenberg and Site Editor surfaces.
- 8 recommendation surfaces.
- 30 defined Abilities API contracts.
- Admin approval/audit page.
- External agents can request style applies, but admins decide.

### Slide 2 — Architecture

**Title:** One governed loop across human and agent workflows

**Diagram**

→ WordPress Abilities API
→ Recommendation executor
→ strict response schemas
→ operation validators
→ review-safe / inline-safe / advisory classification

**Small table**

| Control               | What it prevents                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Strict schemas        | Free-form model output becoming executable |
| Operation validators  | Unsupported block/style/template mutations |
| Review gates          | Silent structural or theme-level changes   |
| Server activity       | Untraceable AI actions                     |

## Portfolio summary

Flavor Agent is a governance layer for AI-mediated WordPress changes.

It lets AI propose block, pattern, content, template, template-part, navigation, Global Styles, and Style Book recommendations inside native WordPress editing surfaces, while WordPress keeps control of validation, review, attribution, freshness checks, and undo.

The key design principle is: AI proposes; WordPress approves.

**Status:** `0.1.0` release candidate / pre-tag.

## What I built

- Native Gutenberg and Site Editor recommendation surfaces.
- A server-backed activity/audit system for AI requests and applied changes.
- Drift-safe undo for Flavor Agent-owned executable changes.
- Strict response schemas and bounded operation validators.
- Contextual ranking with model, deterministic, and context score components.
- Recommendation outcome diagnostics for shown, selected, blocked, failed, and inserted states.
- WordPress Abilities API contracts for recommendations, previews, helpers, docs search, infra, and governed external apply.
- MCP exposure for external agents, with admin-only approval retained in WordPress.
- A self-signed attestation layer for approved external style applies, with public verification endpoints for signed statements, site keys, and live subject-state digests.

## Safety boundaries

Flavor Agent does not auto-publish content, silently rewrite posts, contact site visitors, or own text-generation credentials. Text generation runs through the WordPress AI Client and `Settings > Connectors`, and falls back to Jetpack AI over an existing Jetpack connection where the WordPress AI Client runtime is absent. Plugin-owned settings cover embeddings, pattern retrieval, docs grounding, guidelines, and sync.

Attestation v1 is site-key self-attestation only: no C2PA, no third-party identity, no transparency log, and no prompts, provider payloads, or PII in signed statements.

## Verify locally

Representative local verification depends on the prepared nightly/trunk WordPress environment described in [reference/local-environment-setup.md](reference/local-environment-setup.md): Docker, companion plugins, `Settings > Connectors`, Playwright browsers, and the host-side Plugin Check prerequisites are all part of the contract. From that prepared environment, use:

```bash
npm run verify -- --skip-e2e      # fast non-browser loop
npm run test:e2e:playground       # Playground smoke
npm run test:e2e:wp70             # Docker-backed WP 7.0 harness
npm run verify                    # full recorded pipeline when prerequisites are ready
```

If Plugin Check prerequisites are unavailable locally, `npm run verify -- --skip=lint-plugin` is an explicit coverage waiver for iteration, not release-signoff evidence.

## Demo sequence

### In-editor (governed UI)

1. Show `Settings > Flavor Agent` readiness: Connectors-owned text generation plus plugin-owned pattern/docs/embedding configuration.
2. Show a Block Inspector recommendation with bounded inline apply and undo.
3. Show a Global Styles or Style Book recommendation in review-first mode.
4. Show `Settings > AI Activity` with a pending external style apply.
5. Approve or reject the pending row and inspect provenance, freshness evidence, before/proposed/after comparison, undo state, and — when a signing key is configured — the row's attestation verify affordance.
6. Show pattern recommendations in the native inserter shelf as browse/rank-first, not plugin-owned mutation.

### Programmatic (external agent via MCP)

The same governance model an outside agent sees — verified end-to-end against a live site.

1. **Discover.** `discover-abilities` on the universal default server returns the public MCP surface: ten read helpers, five signature-only `preview-recommend-*` dry runs, and the separate `search-wordpress-docs` tool (16 public abilities total). `get-ability-info` shows each contract's input/output schema. The seven `recommend-*` and four apply/activity tools live on the dedicated `flavor-agent` MCP server; neither server exposes an approve/decision tool — approval stays admin-only in wp-admin.
2. **Read.** `execute-ability` on a read-only ability (e.g. `get-active-theme`, or a `preview-recommend-*` signature preflight) executes without invoking the AI Connector.
3. **Propose.** `recommend-style` returns a bounded, preset-backed operation plus review/apply freshness signatures, and records a diagnostic activity row.
4. **Request.** `request-style-apply` with the operation, the live `currentConfig`, and those signatures creates a pending row and mutates nothing. Freshness is enforced on two gates — recomputed signatures and `currentConfig` equal to the live entity; stale input is rejected as drift (re-derive with `preview-recommend-style`).
5. **Approve.** An administrator approves the pending row in `Settings > AI Activity`; a second freshness check runs against the live entity before the change applies.
6. **Attest & verify.** `get-activity` returns the row's attestation links for the public envelope, live subject-state, and the admin-facing site-run verification summary. With a signing key configured, independent verification is still `php tools/attestation-verify.php <baseUrl> <attestationId>` against the public envelope, JWKS (`/attestations/keys`), and live subject-state endpoints — no credentials — reporting signature validity, live-subject match, revert/supersession accountability, and tamper detection.
7. **Reverse.** `undo-activity` restores the before-state when the live document still matches the recorded after-state, and emits a chained revert attestation.

> **Presenter notes:** attestation is key-gated — without `FLAVOR_AGENT_ATTEST_PRIVATE_KEY` (base64 Ed25519 secret) it records no attestation rather than a fake one. The external MCP client authenticates with a WordPress Application Password over HTTPS.

---

> **Authoring note:** built with Claude-assisted development held to the standard this project applies to AI — every AI-drafted change reviewed before merge, attributed in version control, and reversible. The governance pattern isn't only the product; it's how the product was made.

## 5) LinkedIn project section

**Flavor Agent — Governance layer for AI-mediated WordPress changes**

Agent governance isn't a WordPress-shaped problem — any system that lets AI act on live state needs the same guarantees: bounded operations, gated review, attribution, provable rollback. I built the layer on WordPress because that's where my depth is; the pattern is portable.

Built a WordPress plugin that lets AI propose site-editing changes without giving the model unchecked control. Flavor Agent integrates into native Gutenberg, Site Editor, and wp-admin surfaces, including block recommendations, pattern ranking, content suggestions, template/template-part recommendations, Global Styles, Style Book, navigation guidance, and `Settings > AI Activity`.

The core work is a governed mutation loop: strict schemas, bounded operation validators, review gates for structural/theme changes, server-backed activity attribution, freshness checks, optional site-key attestation, and drift-safe undo. The registry defines 30 WordPress Ability contracts and exposes MCP tools for external agents while keeping approval admin-only inside WordPress.

**Highlights:** WordPress Abilities API, MCP, Ed25519 self-attestation, PHP 8.2, Gutenberg, Site Editor, `@wordpress/*` packages (React), DataViews, Playwright, PHPUnit, Jest. Optional retrieval/grounding infrastructure: Cloudflare AI Search, Cloudflare Workers AI, Qdrant.

## 7) Claims to avoid in public copy

Do **not** say:

- "Autonomous WordPress agent."
- "Automatically edits/publishes your site."
- "REST API recommendation endpoints."
- "External agents can apply any WordPress change."
- "Cloudflare docs grounding blocks unsafe recommendations."
- "Full observability product."
- "C2PA Content Credentials."
- "Third-party verified provenance."
- "Transparency-log-backed attestations."
- "Attestations for every recommendation/apply surface."
- "Production adoption metrics" unless you have real usage data.
- "Production" as a maturity claim while the project is pre-tag with no installs.

Say instead:

> Flavor Agent is a WordPress-native governance layer for AI-mediated changes: bounded recommendations, review-gated mutation, server-side attribution, optional self-signed site-key attestation for governed external style applies, and drift-safe undo.
